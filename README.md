# snippet-recorder
The idea is to create an interactive album of reusable code snippets

Currently is a simple setup project with:
- Webpack
- Typescript
- React

Webpack config:
- Babel
- rules
  - can includes images -> see config for extensions
  - can includes .css -> no support for compilers (scss, sass) coming soon
  - can includes fonts -> see config for extensions
